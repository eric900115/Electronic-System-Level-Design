NTHU Electronic System Level Design and Synthesis
---
**HW1 SystemC**
> Implement a Gaussian blur filter in SystemC using FIFO channels both with and without data buffers.

**HW2 TLM**
> Implement Gaussian Blur Filter with TLM interface.

> Implement Gaussian Blur Filter with Quantum Keeper.

> Implement Gaussian Blur Filter with TLM interconnect.

**HW3 High-Level Synthesis**
> Design a HLS synthesizable version of the Gaussian Blur Filter module.

> Use Cadence Stratus directive to optimize the design.
